            Hello! I&apos;m Matt, a Grip in the film industry with a deep passion for photography, creating, and coding.

            My journey in the film world really took off during a challenging global period, where I found my niche working behind the scenes in Vancouver. This was a time that tested and honed my storytelling abilities and allowed me to make a unique contribution to the art of visual storytelling. After this period, the industry faced another hurdle: the longest actor and writer strike in history. This unexpected twist reignited my long-standing interest in data and coding. It was a perfect chance to revisit and refine these skills, blending them with my film experience.

            My earlier days were marked by roles in branding and marketing at Aurora Cannabis, where I dived into the fast-paced world of brand building. I&apos;ve also ventured into entrepreneurship, launching my own business. While it didn&apos;t take off as I hoped, the experience was rich with lessons. Branding has always been a central aspect of my work. I thrive on turning ideas into tangible, resonant brands. This path has equipped me with a diverse skill set, from crafting narratives in film to developing strong brand identities and navigating business complexities.

            What really excites me is collaborating with other creative minds.

            There&apos;s a special thrill in bringing an idea to life, nurturing it from concept to reality. With such a varied background, I&apos;m looking forward to what the future holds â€“ more creative projects, more innovation, and more impactful accomplishments.
