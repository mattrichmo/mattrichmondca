        Throughout my journey, I've truly embodied the roles of a "Creator" and "Builder," traits that have defined my path. My recent experiences have been quite diverse; during the pandemic, I immersed myself in the Vancouver film industry as a Grip, contributing to the magic of visual storytelling behind the scenes. Before that, I found myself engaged in brand-building endeavors within the dynamic landscape of Aurora Cannabis. Reflecting on my journey, I ventured into entrepreneurship with my own company, a venture that might not have reached the heights I envisioned, but one that undoubtedly enriched me with invaluable lessons.        </p>

          My earlier days were marked by a deep involvement in creating brands, an arena where my passion for shaping concepts into something substantial truly shone. Each step has added to my arsenal of skillsâ€”whether it was the art of crafting compelling narratives in the film industry, establishing resonant brand identities, or navigating the complexities of running a business.
